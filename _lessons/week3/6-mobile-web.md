# The Mobile Web

In quick summary of something you already know: the mobile web is here. At the moment [around 60%](http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/21/majority-of-digital-media-consumption-now-takes-place-in-mobile-apps/) of traffic on the internet comes from mobile devices. Read that again. *60%*. If you're a business planning a website, it makes more sense to build a mobile-only website than a desktop-only website. And yet, so many businesses do just the opposite.

Many companies' mobile strategy is fragmented and badly planned. These terrible user experiences have real-world implications for businesses. A [report](http://www.themobileplaybook.com/en-us/#/chapter2_1 "The Mobile Playbook") by Google indicates that "*40% [of users] have turned to a competitor's site after a bad mobile experience.*" In 2015 there's simply no excuse for messing up mobile web design. Luckily this week we'll start to see how to do it well!
