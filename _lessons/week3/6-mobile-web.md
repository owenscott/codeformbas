# The Mobile Web

(If you're at risk of running short on time you may want to skip this section and read it after!)

Just a few years ago, web developers could comfortably assume that all users would be visiting their website on a desktop computer or a laptop. Not so much anymore. At the moment [around 60%](http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/21/majority-of-digital-media-consumption-now-takes-place-in-mobile-apps/) of traffic on the internet comes from mobile devices. Read that again. *60%*. If you're a business planning a website, it makes more sense to build a mobile-only website than a desktop-only website. And yet, so many businesses do just the opposite.

Many companies' mobile strategy is fragmented and badly planned. Detached mobile websites (e.g. m.whatever.com) are built, requiring developers to maintain all of the site's content in two different places, often leading to incomplete experiences on both mobile and desktop. Or, worse, companies invest in mobile apps at the expense of their website, adding an obnoxious popup window to try to get you to download their app.

These terrible user experiences have real-world implications for businesses. A [report](http://www.themobileplaybook.com/en-us/#/chapter2_1 "The Mobile Playbook") by Google indicates that "*40% [of users] have turned to a competitor's site after a bad mobile experience.*" In 2015 there's simply no excuse for messing up mobile web design. Luckily this week we'll start to see how to do it well!
