# Homework

## Essential

1. Complete [Project 3](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/projects "Dash Project 3") of the General Assembly Dash curriculum.

## Bonus

1. If you really want to learn the guts of responsive web design, [Learn Layout](http://learnlayout.com/ "Learn Layout") is a short, amazing tutorial. As you read through it, try to build some example pages yourself. 
2. If you're **really** getting into this stuff, then consider a cash outlay on Ethan Marcotte's book [Responsive Web Design](http://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design "Responsive Web Design book") which launched this entire design paradigm. It's a great read and extremely beginner-friendly.
