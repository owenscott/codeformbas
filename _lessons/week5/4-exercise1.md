# Exercise 1

Check out the following [website](examples/ "Week 5 Exercise 1"). It's a simple blog with a very simple layout.

However now take a look at the [stylesheet](examples/style.css "Week 5 Exercise 1 Stylesheet"). It's a bit of a mess! Clearly some technical debt has been incurred.

**Your Mission:** Download the example website [here](examples/w5e1.zip "Week 5 Exercise 1 .zip file") and edit the CSS file. Your goal is to minimize the number of lines of CSS without changing **anything** about the site's appearance. Be careful about how it looks on a mobile phone (or in a narrow browser window) as well!

One note. At our company, we have strict style guides for CSS. Good CSS must look like this:

    .by-line {
      font-style: italic;
      font-size: 14px;
    }

This style-guide is very stricly enforced. Therefore, even in your quest to minimize the number of lines of CSS, don't even think about doing something like this:

    .by-line { font-style: italic; font-size: 14px; }

You certainly won't gain any points, and your co-workers will not be happy. Any badly formatted CSS will be properly reformated before lines are counted...
