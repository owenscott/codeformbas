# Exercise 1

Create a new empty webpage and add a `<script>` tag to it. Log the words 'Hello World!' into the console using the following code snipped:

    console.log('Hello World!');

Open your webpage and verify that the words are displayed in the developer tools console. Once you have it working, try replacing the `console.log()` statement with:

    alert('Hello World!');

What happens when you open the page?
