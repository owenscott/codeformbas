If you want to really dive into JavaScript the now is a great time to burn 45 minutes on CodeSchool's [JavaScript Roadtrip](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-1 "JavaScript Road Trip"). Don't forget to try to work some of the tricks you learn into live webpages.

If you prefer to work on core HTML and CSS knowledge, I'd suggest catching up on some of the homework's from previous weeks for review.
