# Basics

Our philosophy this week is to sidestep programming language syntax as much as possible, rather than teach it. However, some very basic examples should be helpful.

The following snipped of code creates a new `variable`.

    var myNumber = 4;

All this means is that we've created a variable called `myNumber` and assigned it a value of `4`. We can access that value again later in the program.

    var myNumber = 4;
    var myOtherNumber = 6;

    var mySum = myNumber + myOtherNumber;

    console.log(mySum);

In the above example `mySum` will be equal to `10`. The `console.log` statement prints the value of `mySum` into developer tools console.
