# Introduction

This week we are going to look at JavaScript. JavaScript is a programming language which allows us to make webpages interactive. JavaScript is the only programming language which can run in web browsers, and so web developers end up writing quite a lot of it (whether they like JavaScript or not!).

Our introduction this week will be **very** simple. If you want to learn more JavaScript you should make sure to check out the homework.
