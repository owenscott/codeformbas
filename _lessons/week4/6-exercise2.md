# Exercise 2

Create a simple webpage with an `<h1>` tag and a `<button>`. Write a JavaScript program to log something into the console every time the button is pushed. Use the previous section for guidance but make sure you write all the code yourself - no copy-and-pasting!

(Also, this is a good time to accept the fact that programming languages are very very picky about syntax. Make sure you are diligent about all of your brackets!).
