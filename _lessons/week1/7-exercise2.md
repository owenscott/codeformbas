# Exercise 2

## Part 1
To start, go back to the website which you made in *Exercise 1* and open up the developer tools console. (Remember, `ctrl-shift-i` on Windows or `alt-cmd-i` on Mac). Now go to the *Elements* tab and take a look at the HTML. Prototype 1-2 small changes to your website by double clicking on the HTML elements and editing their contents.

## Part 2
Now you're ready to try out developer tools on some HTML in the wild. Be forewarned though - HTML on full-featured websites can be much more complicated than what you've been dealing with today.

For your first foray, visit the [website for the Cambridge MBA Program](http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/programmes/mba/ "Cambridge MBA Website"). Open up developer tools and have a look around. Once you're feeling comfortable with the layout, try defacing the website slightly in a hilarious (but tasteful) manner.

Great, you're done for today!
