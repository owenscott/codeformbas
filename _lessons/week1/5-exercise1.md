# Exercise 1
For our first exercise we will make a very simple webpage, building on the example in the previous sections. First pick a list of something (favourite bands, top news websites, best mushroom quiche recipes, etc.) and make a website listing some links. When you're done, your webpage should look like the one in the following image. (Don't worry, we will make cooler websites before this course is over!)

[![Business Schools in Europe](img/bschools.png "Business Schools in Europe")](examples/bschools.html)

To start, make a folder on your computer named `MBA_Coding_Course` and then create another folder within it named `week1_site`. Now open Sublime Text and create a file called `index.html` inside the `week1_site` folder.

[![index.html](img/folder.png "index.html in your course folder")](img/folder.png)

[![Sublime Text](img/sublime.png "Sublime Text")](img/sublime.png)

Now create an HTML webpage in the `index.html` file, using the notes in the previous two sections as examples. When you are done, save the file in Sublime Text and double click on it in Finder / Windows Explorer. It should open automatically in your default browser.
