# Homework

For this first week we are going to focus simply on getting our HTML chops up. This practice is essential - once we have a solid foundation with the basic technologies we can build into much more exciting things. Luckily, great resources exist to help you practice!

## Essential

Create an account on [General Assembly Dash](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/ "General Assembly Dash") and try out *Project 1: Build a Personal Website*. This should take about 30 minutes and provides great practice.

## Bonus

Repetition, repetition, repetition. Nothing is more important. If you've got some time to hack on this stuff, also consider trying out [Codeschool's Free intro to HTML and CSS](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/front-end-foundations "Code School Intro Course"). Their videos and courses are top notch, and they tackle things are a *bit* more of an advanced pace than we have so far (while still remaining accessible). 

Otherwise, now is a great time to start working on a personal website or project. Maybe something for your EP or for an event that you're organizing. This is the number one thing you can do if you want to maximize the value that you get from this course. Feel free to email me if you have any questions!
