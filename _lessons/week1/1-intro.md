# Introduction
Welcome to your first coding course at the Said Business School! This set of classes offers a few things:
* a change to see how the internet works
* an opportunity to get some day-to-day insight into software management from a developer's perspective
* exposure to the tools you need to *learn* how to learn software development

Every week we will have a 50 minute session and about 60 minutes of homework. The sessions are largely self-paced, so if you can't finish in class, then you can use the material on this website to finish on your own. 

For the course we will be using the [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/ "Google Chrome Download Page") browser and [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/ "Sublime Text Download Page") text editor. If you haven't downloaded and installed these programs please do so now.
