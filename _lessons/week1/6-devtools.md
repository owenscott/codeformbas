# Developer Tools

Developer Tools are a fantastic way to explore and debug live websites, as well as test modifications. You can use them for debugging your own work, or for making quick suggestions/tests on a product someone is developing for you.

To open developer tools in Google Chrome, press `ctrl-shift-i` on Windows or `alt-command-i` on Mac. You should see a window like this one appear in your browser:

You'll see that the developer tools console has a number of tabs. For today, we will focus on the *Elements* tab, which allows us to examine the HTML for any website on the internet.

Using the elements tab, we can explore the HTML on a webpage directly. Clicking on a particular HTML element will highlight that element on our webpage (in blue).

By double clicking on an element, you can also change the contents of HTML tags.

Throughout this course, we will use developer tools to explore how you can inspect live websites and try out small changes. This can be extremely useful when you're working on your own sites, or when you're managing the development of a site which someone else is working on.
