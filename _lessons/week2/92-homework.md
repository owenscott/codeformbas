# Homework

## Essential

1. Complete [project 2](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/projects "General Assembly Project 2") on General Assembly Dash.
2. Try your hand at the [CSS Selectors Game](http://flukeout.github.io/ "CSS Selectors Game"). It might be a bit too advanced for you to finish all of the levels (prove me wrong!) but see if you can get through the first 10 levels.

## Bonus

1. Read Joel Spolsky's absolute classic [The Iceberg Secret Revealed](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000356.html "The Iceberg Secret Revealed"), on the relationship between technical and non-technical managers. Quoting: *It's pretty clear that programmers think in one language, and MBAs think in another. I've been thinking about the problem of communication in software management for a while, because it's pretty clear to me that the **power and rewards** accrue to those rare individuals who know how to translate between Programmerese and MBAese.* Enough said - give it a read!
