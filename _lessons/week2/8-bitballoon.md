# BitBalloon

Deploying webpages onto the internet used to be very difficult. However, recently one company has made it shockingly easy. We're going to use them now to get our site online.

BitBalloon is extremely easy to use. To try them out, simply navigate to their homepage and drag your folder from the last exercise (containing `style.css` and `index.html`) into the section where it says "Drag Your Site Folder Here". You don't need to create an account or anything.

If all goes well, you should see something like this:

Once you have completed this step, your website should be available online. In the example above, the website is now available at the (randomly generated) URL: [publisher-ape-28114.bitballoon.com](http://publisher-ape-28114.bitballoon.com "Randomly Generated BitBalloon URL"). When you use BitBalloon without a user account, the website will only be online for a limited time. 

Before next week you should create a user account for BitBalloon. You can do this by creating a [Github](http://www.github.com/ "Github") user account, and using it to log into BitBalloon. Pick your Github user name carefully, as in the programming world it's an important professional credential. (Similar to how having a good Twitter handle can be important in certain circles.)
