# Exercise 1
In this exercise we will practice applying CSS to an existing webpage. Download [this folder](examples/exercise1.zip "Week 2 Exercise 1") and extract it. You should see three files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `answer.png`.

The goal of the exercise is to add CSS rules to `style.css` until `index.html` looks like `answer.png`. Currently `index.html` looks like this:

Some further guidance is provided below. The instructions are intentionally a little bit vague, to force you to have to search for things on the internet. I've included some suggested Google search words with each line. And remember - **always write your CSS yourself**! Cutting and pasting might seem easier, but in reality it's the most efficient way to learn nothing.

* add 20 pixels (`20px`) of top padding and 40 pixels (`40px`) of left-side padding to the `body` element. (Suggested Search Words: "CSS Padding")
* make the background color light yellow (Suggested Search Words: "CSS Background Color", "CSS Color Names")
* make the `<h1>` font color dark blue (Suggested Search Words: "CSS Font Color")
* set the `<h1>` font to `Verdana` (Suggested Search Words: "CSS Font Family")
* set the rest of the page's font to `Helvetica`
* add 5px of padding to each `<li>` element to space them out slightly
* change the bullets on the list to be squares rather than circles (Suggested Search Words: "CSS List Bullet Style")

When you're done, the webpage should look like this:

If you happen to be working on this after class and get really stuck, you can download a folder with the answers [here](examples/exercise1-answers.zip "Week 2 Exercise 1 Answers"). However, it is really important to try this yourself for a while first.
