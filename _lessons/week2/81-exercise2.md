# Exercise 2

Last week you made a [simple website](http://localhost:8000/lessons/week1/#exercise1 "Week 1 Exercise 1") listing things you like. This week it's time to add some style!

* Use your new CSS skills to add some flair to your website. Edit the colors and fonts, and also search around on the internet for other ideas that you haven't seen yet in this lesson. Be creative.
* Deploy your website to BitBalloon by dragging its entire folder into their upload interface, as shown in the previous section.
* Ask your neighbour to use their computer to verify that your BitBalloon website works. 
* Congratulations: you've just put your first website onto the internet! High-five someone!!!
