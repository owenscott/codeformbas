# Introduction
Welcome to the second week of the course! This week we will start by looking in a bit more depth at networks function, and then will dive head first into Cascading Stylesheets (CSS). By the end of the lesson you should have:

* a better understanding of how client-server archictecture on the internet works
* an understanding of how server-side frameworks (Ruby on Rails, Python/Django, etc.) relate the coding we're doing in this course
* an understanding of how CSS selectors work, and how to write a targeted CSS selector for a part of your webpage
* experience writing your own CSS to change and improve the style of a webpage
* experience deploying a website onto the World Wide Web

Wow, big week. Let's get started!
